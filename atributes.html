<h2>The story</h2>
<blockquote class="text">
    <p class="bold">Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. They said,<q class="farmer"> We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.</q> The farmer said, <em><q class="farmer">“Maybe.”</q></em> The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said, <q class="farmer">Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!</q> The farmer again said, <em><q class="farmer">“Maybe.”</q></em> </p>

    <p>The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then said, <q class="villager">“Oh dear, that’s too bad</q>, and the farmer responded, <strong><q>“Maybe.”</q></strong> The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said, <q class="villager">Isn’t that great!</q> Again, he said, <strong><q class="farmer">“Maybe.”</q></strong></p>

    <p>The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is good or bad — because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of good fortune.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>
    <strong class="good">Good</strong> and <strong class="bad">Bad</strong> are just one perspective. Bananas are <strong class="good">good</strong> for monkeys, but monkeys are not <strong class="good">good</strong> for bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it...</p>
